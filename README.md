# GhostArm
Project for FHTW - BE25 SS26 - GroupQ

Ghost Arm is a university research prototype that captures muscle activity via surface electromyography (EMG), processes the signal in real time, and maps the extracted activation level to an output interface designed to reproduce a corresponding contraction pattern. The project focuses on signal acquisition, filtering, normalization, and low-latency control to demonstrate the conceptual pipeline from biological input to externally actuated response.
